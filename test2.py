# commit
# in order to commit something first it need to added in staged directory which requires git add command
# git commit permanently add changes in github repo where git add allows you add changes in staged directory 
# git add also allows control of which files need to added and it requires no message
# git commit requires message attached with it

# first do git add and then do git commit(helps track of changes in better way)

# once file is added there will be a A(icon at the end of file in tree structure)

# once changes are commited then in order them to reflect into repo we have to run git push command

# commit creates a history line everytime(so for timelines use git commit, to stage them use git add and to push final changes to use git push)
